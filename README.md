A MK4 PSU holder for the Lack Enclosure.

I have built a Lack enclosure for my MK4 printer, but I have put it on top of a Malm drawer unit. That means, that the bottom Lack table I used for the enclosure doesnÂ´t have it's legs attached. All designs I have seen so far for putting the PSU outside the enclosure were meant to be attached to the legs of the bottom Lack table. I ended up screwing the PSU holder I printed to the back left leg of the upper Lack table, but that means, that removing the top table was always a bit of a hassle, as the PSU cable now connected the two tables.

So I designed this really simple PSU holder which you can screw to the side of the bottom table plate. The PSU slides right into it and thus it no longer connects the two tables, allowing you to remove the top table any time you want.

***Note:** This holder is designed for the black PSU. I don't know if it fits the silver one as well. But as it's a parametric OpenSCAD design, you can easily adjust the dimensions to fit your PSU. If you've got measurements for the silver PSU, please let me know and I'll add them to the design.*
